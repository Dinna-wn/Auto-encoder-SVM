# Auto-encoder-SVM


The goal of this work is to develop a convolutional autoencoder to encode and reconstruct images of two animal species: cows and elephants. 
Then, to apply a SVM on the embedding generated by the encoder in order to classify the images of cows and elephants. The practical work consists
also in comparing between a SVM applied directly on the original data and a SVM applied on the embedding generated by the encoder.

Task 1: Architecture setup and model training

Task 2: Model Evaluation
First, we apply the autoencoder made in Task 1 on the test data to produce reconstruction of the original images.

Second, we take the encoder part of the autoencoder trained in Task 1 and then run all the images from the test data. Then, we retrieve the output 
of the encoder that represents the vector that encodes the test data.

Third:
- Apply a linear SVM* with cross validation on the embedding.
- Display the result of the training of the SVM with cross-validation using the accuracy (Accuracy).

Fourth:
- we Visualize the embedding in two dimensions: Display in a scatter plot of the embedding associated with the test data using TSNE-2Dâ€ .
- we Apply a linear SVM with cross-validation directly to the original test data.
